# CursorCreate-and-Mousecape-on-the-Mac
Using CursorCreate &amp; Mousecape to help getting some of all the Windows cursors over onto macOS
A guide to using CursorCreate on macOS for the purpose of using it with Mousecape
-

Now on macOS Monterey and macOS Big Sur - we are lucky that Isaac has updated his CursorCreate application for use on these platforms. I never got to tell him that his new release works just fine. I hope he reads this; it works :D

This older tutorial is made using macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and latest releases of both Mousecape and CursorCreate. You won't see Mousecape in action in this tutorial. I'll let you try these conversions yourself.
There's always asking for assistance on the Mousecape repo ðŸ˜€

You should begin by downloading CursorCreate from: https://github.com/isaacrobinson2000/CursorCreate/releases

For the purpose of following all the steps in this wiki entry I suggest downloading:

http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/hello-kitty-3

You can read all about the workings of CursorCreate on its repository too.


CursorCreate is being described like this on its repository:
```
A Multi-platform Cursor Theme Building Program.

CursorCreate allows you to build cursor themes for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It supports reading cursors from svg, xcur, cur, ani, and all image formats supported by the Pillow imaging library. Also includes a GUI for easily modifying cursor projects.
```

Now we're using CursorCreate and the Hello Kitty cursor set for the duration of this wiki entry. 

Please, look at the imbedded images and watch the video too. 
This is a tutorial made on the notion that the above-mentioned files are downloaded.
